## Common Problems/FAQ
**_This mod list is way too large. My computer can't handle this._**
Sorry, but these mods are essential for playing CatSMP and to have a genuinely good experience.

**_I get an error when starting saying my Java version is incompatible. Help._**
Right click your instance from the Prism home, and click Edit in the context menu. Then, go to `Settings` on the left sidebar, hit the `Java` tab and then tick `Java Installation`. Click `Auto Detect` and select Java 17, 18 or 21. **Any lower will not work. If you selected Java 18 or Java 21, please tick "Skip Java compatibility checks" to avoid further errors.**

**_I'm lagging really hard in-game and cannot play._**
Please allocate more ram to your instance. If you don't know how, follow this:
Right click your instance from the Prism home, and click `Edit` in the context menu. Then, go to `Settings` on the left sidebar, hit the `Java` tab. Then, tick `Memory` and increase the Minimum Memory Allocation. **Make sure to NEVER go higher than 7 GB of ram if you have a 16 GB of ram computer.**
